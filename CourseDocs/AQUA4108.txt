MAJOR TOPICS:

This course is designed to provide an overview of the criteria for selecting a suitable aquaculture site, including land-based and open-water sites for finfish and shellfish species

Water Requirements; Technical Site Studies; Finfish and Shellfish Farm Planning

Duration:	65 hours

1)  To give students an understanding and practical experience of site selection criteria and techniques. This course is taught with  special reference to finfish and shellfish farm developments and opportunities in Newfoundland, elsewhere in Canada and in other regions of the world.

2)  To make students aware of the various environmental, social and economic factors that may affect site selection criteria.

3)  To give students an understanding and practical experience of the water requirements and fish farm planning logistics related to land-based and open water culture sites.
