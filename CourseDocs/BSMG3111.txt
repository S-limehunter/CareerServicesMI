(Environmental Assessment)

TYPE & PURPOSE:	This is an advanced level course that will use discussion and analysis of relevant, recent and real-world projects and their assessments, with a particular focus on EA requirements and experiences in marine-related industries, to enable students to develop an understanding of the environmental assessment (EA) process, particularly as it applies to proposed developments and key issues in the marine environment.

CALENDAR ENTRY:	EA Definitions and Concepts; Provincial and Federal EA Processes; EA Stages and Components (including Case Studies); Issues in EA Practice; Post EA Requirements

PREREQUISITE: 	BSMG 2104 (Policy and Law)

SCHEDULE:	Duration: 	13 weeks
Lectures:  	  3 hours/week = 39 hours

COURSE AIMS:	To enable students to develop an understanding of:
1)  EA, including its origins, rationale, definition, key concepts and principles.
2)  Provincial and Federal EA processes and requirements.
3)  The various stages involved in conducting an EA, including its analytical and consultative components, and to explore key issues in contemporary EA practice.
4)  Post-EA requirements and processes, including permitting and environmental compliance and effects monitoring.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
THE EXPECTED LEARNING OUTCOME IS THAT THE STUDENT WILL BE ABLE TO:
1.0  EA Definitions and Concepts 
1.1  EA Definitions
* Define EA and identify its key components and principles.
1.2  EA Origins and Rationale
* Describe the rationale for EA and its origins and evolution.
1.3  EA Components and Application
* List and define the major stages and aspects of an EA.
2.0  Provincial and Federal EA Processes 
2.1  Newfoundland and Labrador EA Legislation and Regulations
* Identify the legislative basis for provincial EA in Newfoundland and Labrador.
* Describe the main objectives, stages and possible outcomes of the provincial EA process.
2.2  Canadian (Federal) EA Legislation and Regulations
* Identify the legislative basis for federal EA in Canada.
* Describe the main objectives, stages and possible outcomes of the federal EA process.
2.3  Other Applicable EA Processes
* Identify and describe other EA processes that may apply to proposed developments offshore Newfoundland and Labrador.
2.4  EA Harmonization 
* Discuss the principle of ‘”one project - one assessment” and the ways this is achieved through inter-jurisdictional EA cooperation in Canada.
3.0  EA Stages and Components (including Case Studies)
* Identify and describe the main stages of conducting an EA for a major development activity, including each of the components listed below: 
* Project Description
* Screening and Scoping
* Consultation
* Existing Environment
* Effects Analysis
* Effects Management
* Residual Effects Evaluation
* Review and Decision-making 
* Monitoring and Follow-up
4.0  Issues in EA Practice
4.1  EA Objectives, Outcomes and Effectiveness
* Discuss key issues and evolving views around how EAs should be conducted and their potential uses and outcomes.
4.2  Public and Indigenous Consultation  
* Describe the principles of and requirements for consultation in EA, including:
* when and how it is carried out,
* typical EA participants and interests in the marine sector, and 
* key consultation benefits and outcomes. 
4.3  Cumulative Effects
* Define cumulative effects, and identify approaches to, and key challenges in, their assessment and management. 
4.4  Strategic and Regional Assessments
* Define strategic and regional assessments and discuss their rationale, perceived benefits over project-specific EA, and current application in Canada.
5.0  Post EA Requirements
5.1  Permitting
* Identify the relationship of EA to subsequent regulatory requirements, and key permits required for developments in the marine environment. 
5.2  Compliance and Enforcement
* Describe and discuss how compliance with EA commitments and obligations is typically enforced and tracked.
5.3  Effects Monitoring 
* Define “environmental effects monitoring (EEM)”.
* Describe some of the methods and environmental parameters that current marine EEM programs have used and focused on.
