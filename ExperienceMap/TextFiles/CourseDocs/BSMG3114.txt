International trade and marine shipping, which is one of its servants, has a rich and noble history. Sea trade has been traced back at least 3 000 years, and indeed, it may be older than that. It is also true that the great explorers including Da Gama, Magellan, Cabot, and Columbus were, first and foremost, sea traders. It was in search of new sea routes and articles of trade that they came upon a “world of new worlds”. The student of Nautical Science must, therefore, be aware of the rich history that is the story of merchant shipping. They must realize that the  “raison d'etre” of shipping was, and is, to serve the needs of  international trade ant that without international and national trade there would be no shipping as we know it today. It can also be stated without much fear of contradiction that if there were no sea trade, the world, as we know it today, simply would not exist.

Furthermore, if the student is to pursue a professional career in international shipping, they must understand that while shipping is an adventure for the young of heart and mind, it is also a very serious business engaged in by business persons for profit. The would-be merchant marine officer must understand the motivation of their employers and understand their role in helping to meet the business objectives of the companies involved. This the merchant mariner can do only if they have a knowledge of the business of shipping that comes with the serious and concentrated study of international trade and the vital role which shipping plays in that trade.

It is one of the purposes of this course to help lay the foundation of a career in merchant shipping. With a solid understanding of the business of shipping, the ship's officer will be a much more competent employee and will make a much greater contribution to the corporate well being of their employer and to modern marine transportation as a whole.

This is an advanced level course designed to build on previous  knowledge regarding ships and the business of shipping obtained in earlier introductory courses. It is meant to give the student an in-depth knowledge of the organization of shipping, shipping operations, and the cargo market. Its focus is the business of shipping.

The course is designed to help the ship's officer understand the evolution of the shipping industry; the production of shipping services; the types and organization of shipping operations; the cargo market  and its organization; and port operations.
