BIOL 2100
(Aquatic Ecology)

TYPE AND PURPOSE:	This is a second level course designed to cover in moderate detail various aspects of aquatic ecology with emphasis on marine ecology. A strong emphasis will be placed on the laboratory sessions which will introduce students to the kinds of data collected during ecological studies in aquatic environments.

CALENDAR ENTRY: 	Ecology and Ecosystems; Primary Production and Feeding Relationships; Population Ecology; Ecological Cycles; and Aquaculture Ecology.

PREREQUISITES: 	SC 1807 (Safety in Science Lab (Lab Safety)); SC 1808 (WHMIS); 
BIOL 1100 (Biology); and STAT 2108 (Applied Statistics)

SCHEDULE: 	Duration:  	13 weeks
Lectures:  	2 hours per week = 26 total hours
Laboratories:   	3 hours once per week = 39 total hours

COURSE AIMS: 	1) To provide a background knowledge of basic ecology including primary   
     production, ecological cycles, and population ecology.
2) To show how the study of aquatic ecology is essential to the study of the 
     freshwater and marine environments.
3) To illustrate how aquaculture and ecosystems may impact each other.
4) To develop the students’ practical skills necessary for assessing marine 
     ecosystems.

EVALUATION: 		Mid-Term Examination	15%
Term Paper 		10%
Laboratory 		45%
Final Examination 	30%
	Total 	100%	

NOTES: 	
1.  Students MUST submit ALL written laboratory reports to successfully pass the course.  Failure to do so will result in a maximum grade of 45% in the course.
2.  A minimum average mark of 5/10 for the laboratory component of the course is required in addition to achieving an overall pass mark in the course. 
3.  Attendance in all laboratory classes is mandatory. Failure to attend, without a satisfactory documented reason, for example a medical certificate issued by a doctor, will mean that the maximum grade possible for this course will be 45 percent.
