PREREQUISITES: SCHEDULE:

Sea-going personnel operate in a changing environment where  awareness of ship management does not end when the owner, manager, or agent steps ashore. Resources must still be managed. The processes involving cargo and navigating systems must be  managed and  controlled and personnel must be motivated to achieve desired ends.
Previously, when profits were high, large shore staffs were maintained to carry out work that may have been more efficiently done on board. With fiscal responsibility and restraint, however, came another awareness - that accidents, injury, and devastation to the environment cannot be prevented from ashore.

Today we have come nearly full circle to the time when ship and cargo owners travelled with their properties and managed everything from on board the vessel. With this change in management style has come the need for more management skills on board the sea-going enterprises. The ship operator must have the technical and communication skills to help manage their enterprises. They carry out the functions of budgeting, planning, and motivating that are required to get their respective cargoes safely and efficiently to market.

One of the purposes of Business and Organizational Management 3116 is to help future officer meet the many challenges that they will face in helping to manage their sea-going enterprises. Ships are now required to have safety management systems. Business and Organizational Management 3116 will help to prepare the ship's officer to meet these new challenges.

This is an advanced level course in shipboard management practices designed for future practicing ship's officers and will lead to an understanding of management practices at sea. It builds on previous knowledge derived from other courses and exposure to actual practice at sea. It is meant to give the student insight into global shipboard management practices and the role they will play as shipboard managers.
