(Fish Identification)

TYPE AND PURPOSE:	This is an intermediate level course that develops the student's understanding of the types of fish that inhabit marine and freshwater habitats of North America. The focus of the course is identification of species and general fish health.

CALENDAR ENTRY: 	Fish Characteristics and Classification; Fish Identification; Fish Health

PREREQUISITES: 	BIOL 1100 (Biology)

SCHEDULE: 		Duration:     	48 hours 
Lecture:	     	 6 total hours
Laboratory: 	42 total hours

COURSE AIMS: 		To enable participants to:
1.  Identify major marine and freshwater species. 
2.  Identify general fish meristic, morphometric and composite characteristics.
3.  Examine the external and internal anatomy of various marine and freshwater fish species.
4.  Identify disease symptoms in fish.


EVALUATION: 		Laboratory 		40%
Assignments 		20%
Quiz 			10%
Final Examination 	30%
Total			100%

NOTES: 	
1.  Students MUST submit ALL written laboratory reports to successfully pass the course.  Failure to do so will result in a maximum grade of 45% in the course.
2.  A minimum average mark of 5/10 for the laboratory component of the course is required in addition to achieving an overall pass mark in the course. 
3.  Attendance in all laboratory classes is mandatory. Failure to attend, without a satisfactory documented reason, for example a medical certificate issued by a doctor, will mean that the maximum grade possible for this course will be 45 percent.
