MAJOR TOPICS:

Immediately following most major disasters at sea, there is a call for new legislation to govern one or another aspect of our maritime industries. One recent example of this was the introduction by the United Sates of the Oil Pollution Act (OPA90) following the grounding of the Exxon Valdez and the subsequent oil spill. This Act created “new laws” for seafarers and for the industry which employs them. It is an excellent case study in how such laws are “created”. Not all maritime law, however, is the result of such dramatic events. Much of it comes down to us through tradition and from many other sources including international conventions.

Whatever the law, its source, or purpose, the seafarer has a very large stake in understanding the nature of marine law and how they get to be a subject of it.  As well, it can be said that for the seafarer, the law is   not just “a matter of interest”. For example, the laws governing marine insurance and salvage as well as the carriage of goods by sea are indeed very practical and every day concerns for the ship's officers.

The two courses in Law and the Environment then, are designed to introduce and elaborate on the elements of maritime law including the law which pertains to the marine environment. It will focus on such topics as marine insurance, salvage, and the carriage of goods by
sea. In addition, it will deal with environmental law including the law that affords the possibility of compensation should the law fail in its purpose to protect society from some acts which unfortunately may involve maritime industries.

This is the first of two advanced level courses designed to bring together the major elements of marine law and the marine environment such  that the student might understand the importance of both in their lives as professional seafarers and the intimate connection between the two.
