EVALUATION:

This course is designed to enable aquaculture workers to gain understanding of the important role harvesting, handling and processing has on product quality and food safety.

Harvesting; Handling and Holding; Processing None
2.5 days

To enable the aquaculture workers/course participants to develop an understanding of:

1)  	The role of harvesting, handling and processing on product quality and the employees’ role in promoting quality.

2)  The Quality Management Program (QMP) as a food safety program and the critical role they play in ensuring food safety.

3)  	The difference between the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s (CFIA) requirement and that of a third party.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
THE EXPECTED LEARNING OUTCOME IS THAT THE STUDENT WILL BE ABLE TO:

1.0  Harvesting
* Identify the two common methods used to corral fish in the cage.
* Describe how the fish can become stressed during harvesting.
* Describe how poor handling during harvest can lead to flesh quality issues.
* List the most common flesh quality issues seen when fish are handled poorly at harvest.
* Define “rigor mortis.”
* Describe the effects of harvesting stress on the quality of the fish.
* List the two methods used to remove fish from the cage.
* Identify the common methods used to stun fish.
* Describe the importance of stunning fish.
* List three common ways that fish are bled and identify the one used in the Newfoundland and Labrador salmonid aquaculture industry.
* Describe the importance of the bleeding on fish quality.
* Discuss the importance of the containment of blood water and fish mortalities.
* Identify the two methods that are commonly used to transport fish to the processing facility.
* Describe the layout of the barge used to harvest the fish.
* Identify the importance of having a consistent and continuous flow of fish from the cage to the holding or transport mode.

2.0  Handling and Holding
2.1  Spoilage and Spoilage Control
* Identify the three types of spoilage and methods used to control them.
* Describe the importance of time and temperature control in maximizing fresh shelf life.
* Discuss the general conditions necessary for the growth of bacteria.
* Describe how bacteria grow.
2.2  Icing
* List and discuss the three principles of icing.
* Describe the importance of contact between the cooling medium and the fish.
* Discuss the importance of water quality in the production.
* Distinguish between direct and indirect icing.
2.3  Handling and Holding
* Describe how salmonids should be handled to maintained and promote a quality product.
* Define the acronyms “CSW” and “RSW.”
* Identify the three most common ways that fish are held and the advantages and disadvantages of each.

3.0  Processing
3.1  Food Safety
* Define the Acronyms “QMP”, “HACCP”, “GMPs”, “SSOP”, “SOP” and “CCP”.
* Describe the QMP as a food safety program.
* Identify potential food safety hazards and how these are controlled.
* Describe the importance of personnel hygiene and sanitation in promoting food safety.

4	AQUA 0006 (Salmonid Harvesting, Handling and Processing)

* State how employees can promote food safety.
* Define what a pathogenic bacterium is and give two examples.
* Describe the importance of time and temperature control in promoting food safety.
3.2  Production
* Identify the processing steps required to produce a fresh head-on gutted salmonid product and describe the purpose of each step.
* Identify the processing steps required to produce a fresh filleted salmonid product and describe the purpose of each step.
* Describe the importance of productivity and yield in the production of salmonid products.
* Discuss the importance of accurate data collection and record keeping.
3.3  Quality
* Define the terms “Quality”, “Quality Characteristics” and “Specifications.”
* Discuss how quality is assessed.
* Distinguish between defect and defective.
* State the minimum quality requirement enforced by CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency).
* Describe the quality characteristics that a head-on gutted salmonid would have to meet the requirements of that market.
* Identify reasons why quality can be downgraded. and how it may be reduced (not sure what is meant here – what is reduced… quality or the downgrading of quality).
* Demonstrate the ability to identify defects in round fish as well as fillets.
3.4  Third Party Certification
* Discuss the purpose of third party certification.
* Briefly describe the differences between CFIA requirements and that of a third party.
* List a third party certification group.©Marine Institute
